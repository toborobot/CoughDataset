# CoughDataset
Cough sounds dataset splitted to 5 classes (covid, upper, lower, obstructive, healthy cough) prepared with COUGHVID dataset (https://coughvid.epfl.ch/). 3325 files wav, 16KHz, mono, 1 seconds duration. Need to be manually checked because this classes based on COUGHVID experts opinion - which is not correct sometimes.
